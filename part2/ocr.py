## Below is just some sample code to show you how the functions above work. 
# You can delete them and put your own code here!


# Each training letter is now stored as a list of characters, where black
#  dots are represented by *'s and white dots are spaces. For example,
#  here's what "a" looks like:
print "\n".join([ r for r in train_letters['a'] ])

# Same with test letters. Here's what the third letter of the test data
#  looks like:
print "\n".join([ r for r in test_letters[2] ])
