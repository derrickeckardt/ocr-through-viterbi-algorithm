# Each training letter is now stored as a list of characters, where black
#  dots are represented by *'s and white dots are spaces. For example,
#  here's what "a" looks like:
# print "\n".join([ r for r in train_letters['p'] ])

# print pprint.pprint(train_letters['P'])
# print len(train_letters['p'])

# Same with test letters. Here's what the third letter of the test data
#  looks like:
# print "\n".join([ r for r in test_letters[2] ])
# for each in test_letters:
# print pprint.pprint(test_letters[2])
print "".join(test_letters[0][6:8])
print "".join(train_letters['T'][6:8])
